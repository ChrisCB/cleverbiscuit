    <h2>Maebellyne’s Awesome Dunking Biscuit Recipe</h2>
<p>Our small business was founded on coffee and Maebellyne's biscuits, taste the love from these amazing biscuits your self by following her recipe:</p>
<p>Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </p>
<p>Toast 110 grams of almonds until lightly browned and fragrant. Let it cool then chop coarsely and set aside. </p>
<p>In a bowl, beat 35 grams granulated sugar and 2 large eggs until thick, pale, and fluffy. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together 225 grams all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt.</p> 
<p>Mix the dry ingredients with the egg mixture and then fold in the chopped almonds and 110 grams chocolate chips.</p>
<p>Transfer the dough to your parchment lined baking sheet and form into a log, about 12 inches long and 3 1/2 inches wide. Bake for 25 minutes, or until firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Reduce the oven temperature to 165 degrees C.  Transfer the log to a cutting board and cut into 3/4 inch slices, on the diagonal.  Place the biscotti, cut side down, on the baking sheet.  Bake for about 10 minutes on each side or until golden brown.</p>
